# Download

The RStudio Desktop can be downloaded from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). As described [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop), the free version has the same features as the paid version but comes with a different lincense (AGPL) and without support.

If you decide to go with the free version, click on the *Download* button located at the bottom of the FREE column and focus on the *Installers* section of the download page. There you should pick  an installer that is pertinent to your operating system -- there is an EXE installer for Windows, DMG for Mac OS X, DEB package for Ubuntu/Debian and RPM for Fedora/RedHat/openSUSE. 

# Installation

Run the installer. When it completes, start the RStudio Desktop so that you can inspect it's user interface.
